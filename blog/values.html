              Tena koutou katoa, my name is mei yang and I am orginally from China, now live in Wellington. My value is honesty, open-minedness, and happiness. Also I love asking quesions and you probably have seen I posted a lot and I am sure you will too in the future. I like to challange myself and learn new stuff, and have been always curious about technology and information and also wanna change my career, so I am here. I am very appreciated that I could attend this class because the value of dev academy is what I agree with too, we are here for skills, experiences and not for scores. 
           </P>
