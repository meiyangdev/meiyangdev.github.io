			<p>1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</p>
			<p>
				It is the ability to perceive, use, understand, manage and handle
				emotions. People with high emotion intelligence can recognise their
				emotions and those of others, use them to guide thinking and behaviour,
				discern between different feelings and label them appropriately, and
				adjust emotions to adapt to environments.
			</p>
			<p>2. How is it different to IQ?</p>
			<p>
				IQ, short for intelligence quotient, is a measure of a person's
				reasoning ability. It is supposed to gauge how well someone can use
				information and logic to answer questions or make predictions.
			</p>
			<p>3. Why is it important?</p>
			<p>
				A high EQ helps you build relationships, reduce team stress, and defuse
				conflicts and improve job satisfication and career success.
