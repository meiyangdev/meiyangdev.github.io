			<h2>Learning Plan At The End Of The Foundations</h2>
			<p>1.What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
			</p>
			<p>Now I want to be a professional full stack developer in the long term and be able to work in freelance. 
			At Dev Academy, my goal is to learn basic coding knowleges about front-end developer and so after I graduate, I would be confident to find an entry level of front-end developer intern or job.
			</p>
			<p>
				2.What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
			</p>
			<p>
				my strength has changed now, previoucsly I quite like to digging stuff, and wanna understand everything that I encounter if possible, now I find that often cost me too much time, now I am doing just-enough studying. Also previoucsly I quite like to ask people immediately if I am stuck, now i will go to search by myself and try to watch youtube, scroll through stackoverflow to try to see if i can solve it myself.
				Now my limitation is that I feel I still spending too much time on some bugs sometimes.
			</p>
			<p>
				3.What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
			</p>
			<p>
				I think it will be from famliy. Since I have not been back to home for 6yrs now, and as the only child in my family, they miss me very much now, so I just have to communicate with them often and tell them that I will go back and visit at the second half year at 2022.
			</p>
			<p>
				4.What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
			</p>
			<p>
				I want to develop pair programming skills and working in teams to do a project. 
			</p>
			<p>
				5.What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
			</p>
			<P>
				I wish if possible we could have 1:1 check every week and also group check often while we are learning to code in groups.
			</P>
			<p>
				6.What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
			</p>
			<p>
				My expectations is to fully dive myself into this bootcamp since this is what i have been wanting for like 4 months now, I have also relocated myself in Nagio now and this will reduce my commute time hopefully and yeah, excited to learn in class and be able to communicate with classmates everyday.
			</p>
			<h2>Learning Plan At The Start Of The Foundations</h2>
			<p>1.What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
			<p>
				&nbsplong-term goal: have my own website and build my online community,
				deliver positive vibes to enjoy life fully;
			</p>
			<p>
				2.A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
				learning
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp strength: inquisitive and always asking questions, like to try and
				not afraid of failure;&nbsp; limitations: like to dig too much for small
				things, not a good typer and often mis-typing; not artistic; can be
				distracted often by digging stuff;
			</p>
			<p>
				3.What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
				developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbspcomminication and cooperations skills in working out a project;
			</p>
			<p>
				4.A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this
				programme.This should include:&nbspAn explanation of how you will manage
				yourself to work productively and safely with other learners,
				facilitators and industry/community representatives
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp I have quit my job, and i am single, also i will relocate to Nagio
				within two weeks, so i have bigger room to study and get close to travel
				to school daily next year;
			</p>
			<p>
				5.A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
			</p>
			<p>
				&nbsp I tend to take a break, like 5mins, then back to google again,
				trying to find solutions and ask for help from slack or my friends; if
				still not solved, I will note down and ask facilitator when it comes to
				weekly check in time.
			</p>
			<p>6.A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>

			<p>
				&nbsp always give me feedback about my reflections and also answer
				qustions in slack which is what you all are doing now, thanks.
			</p>
			<p>
				7.Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
				committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
				commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
