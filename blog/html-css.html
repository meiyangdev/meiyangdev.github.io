what is the difference between relative, absolute and fixed position?
they both use top right bottom and left to help position the element;

however relative is talking about move it from its normal static positon which is the default set of how webpage lay out element;

absolute is talking about moving it from its father's position, image father element stays at some point, however the kid wanna go and play, this is when we use absolute that how far we wanna take the kid to play;

fixed position is talking about the webpage, and it is fixed in the webpage, no matter what changes
