             1. difference between HTML and CSS            
           </p> 
           <P>
              HTML is Hypertext Markup Language and used to edit the content on the webpage. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet Language and used to add style to the content on the webpage.        
           </P>         
           <p>
               HTML is like the skeleton of the human body, while css is like providing looks and appearence to the body.          
           </p>  
           <p>
              2. Explain control flow and loops.           
           </p>
           <p>
               control flow and loops is like building intelligence and logic into webpage. They enable computer to follow the scipts and make decisions and repeat tasks when specific criteria are met.         
           </p>
           <p>
              Conditional statements controls whether a part of scipt is executed depending the result of a particular expression (eg: whether an expression returns a boolean true or false value). It is like a person who is telling himself if tomorrow's weather is nice, he will go hiking.
           </p>
           <p>
              Loop statements are the primary mechanism for telling a computer to perform a same task over and over again untill a set of criteria are met. It is like a determined person in gym is training his hips and doing squats, het sets 10 squats as a set and he will not take break till he repetitively do squats 10 times.          
           </p>

             3.What is DOM? How do we interact with it?            
           </p>
           <p>
              DOM is document object model and it acts as a programming interface to access HTML and defines the logic structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. DOM views an html document as a tree of nodes. Nodes is elements in html (eg head, body).           
           </p>
           <p>
              we can use developer tools like chrome browser and also code editor like VS to interact with it. We can create, change, move elements by using the javascipt language. We can also add events to these elements to make pege interactive.           
           </p>
           <p>
             4. Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.            
           </p>
           <p>
               Array creates and store a list of data in a single varible while objects represents "things" with properties, in which is made of key and values. Arrays is zero-based indexing. We can use both dot and bracket notation to access, add and change and remove iterms in objects and arrays. We can also iterate over array iterms and objects properties by using loops.
