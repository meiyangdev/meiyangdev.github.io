         limitations: like to dig too much for small things, not a good typer and often mis-typing; not artistic; can be distracted often by digging stuff;

      <p>4 I have quit my job, and i am single, also i will relocate to Nagio within two weeks, so i have bigger room to study and get close to travel to school daily next year;
      </p>
      <p>5I tend to take a break, like 5mins, then back to google again, trying to find solutions and ask for help from slack or my friends; if still not solved, I will note down and ask facilitator when it comes to weekly check in time.
