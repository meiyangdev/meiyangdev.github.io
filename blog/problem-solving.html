			<p>1. What was the problem?</p>
			<p>
				It is the super_fizzbuzz challange. So preciously I have coded the
				fizzbuzz and test successfully, and when I jumped to super_fizzbuzz, I
				thought it was just simply rewrite the code and push the result that I
				returned in the original array. However, it was not.
			</p>
			<p>2. What problem solving techniques did you use?</p>
			<p>
				Firstly, I approached slack and post my code for help, a few classmates
				replied me and hinted me that I should use the function fizzbuzz in this
				challange. After getting hint and then I feel my mind is twisted around,
				as i had the idea that we should loop through that array and know that I
				should call the fizzbuzz function, however I did not try to use
				poeudocode.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I messaged Keiko, she said I need to make a varible to store my
				thing before I started to loop. I did not understand why we need to make
				a new varible and she explained beatifully with the example of going to
				supermarket shopping and we always grab a basket before we shopping.
				That is very easy to understand. Then I make a new varible, then I
				started to loop and she said I need to loop to search the iterm in the
				array, and i put down the loop: for (let i = 0 ; i < arr.length; i++){}
				and i knew we need to take every item in arr to test in function
				fizzbuzz, so i put like this : fizzbuzz(arr[i]), then i got stuck to
				where put the result of the fuction fizzbuzz, and keikoe hinted me again
				for making another varible. so i made another varible to get my results.
				then i put the second varible into my first varible by using push.
			</p>
			<p>3. How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
			<p>
				I feel frustrated and annoyed, as it look like everything is twisted, i
				do not know why i need so many varibles and however after i reviewed the
				code again, i find that i wanted to get things together and make the
				results, however this has made it very complicated.
			</p>
			<p>4.What did you learn?</p>
			<p>
				<em>Pseudocode:</em> I love using Pseudocode now as it helps me to sort
				my logic flow, writing down what i need to do in steps has given me a
				clear mind what to do and this also breaks the big stuff to small things
				and make myself clam down
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Trying something:s </em> yes, this is also i often use, i like to
				try things out and this has helped me a lot.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Rubber ducky method:</em> I have not used this method quite often,
				and i think i need to use this later when i was blocked and this might
				be a good way to go through my code
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Reading error messages:</em> yes i love reading it as it gives me a
				clear message where it is wrong.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Console.logging:</em> this is the king, is not it? Console.log helps
				to analyse whether a specific code is working or not
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Googling:</em> my favorite. Basically google everything about it and
				i also love watching youtube clips as i enjoyed media rich learning
				style
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Asking your peers for help:</em> I think probably i am one of the
				person that posted question so often in slack channel.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Asking coaches for help:</em>yes i also asked them quite often, i
				especially like the 1:1 check time so that i could ask questions that
				has been in mind for a long time
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Improving your process with reflection:</em> yes, i think this is
				the one tha i like to do. i like to review my code and think why i got
				stuck at that time and this has made me learned a lot. For instance,
				when i went back to look at the last challenge of using filter function,
				i literally recognised that i should try console.log when i finished one
				line of code, so that i know this line is working.
