			<p>1. What was the problem?</p>
			<p>
				It is the super_fizzbuzz challange. So preciously I have coded the
				fizzbuzz and test successfully, and when I jumped to super_fizzbuzz, I
				thought it was just simply rewrite the code and push the result that I
				returned in the original array. However, it was not.
			</p>
			<p>2. What problem solving techniques did you use?</p>
			<p>
				Firstly, I approached slack and post my code for help, a few classmates
				replied me and hinted me that I should use the function fizzbuzz in this
				challange. After getting hint and then I feel my mind is twisted around,
				as i had the idea that we should loop through that array and know that I
				should call the fizzbuzz function, however I did not try to use
				poeudocode.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then I messaged Keiko, she said I need to make a varible to store my
				thing before I started to loop. I did not understand why we need to make
				a new varible and she explained beatifully with the example of going to
				supermarket shopping and we always grab a basket before we shopping.
				That is very easy to understand. Then I make a new varible, then I
				started to loop and she said I need to loop to search the iterm in the
				array, and i put down the loop: for (let i = 0 ; i < arr.length; i++){}
				and i knew we need to take every item in arr to test in function
				fizzbuzz, so i put like this : fizzbuzz(arr[i]), then i got stuck to
				where put the result of the fuction fizzbuzz, and keikoe hinted me again
				for making another varible. so i made another varible to get my results.
				then i put the second varible into my first varible by using push.
			</p>
			<p>3. How did you feel throughout the process?</p>
			<p>
				I feel frustrated and annoyed, as it look like everything is twisted, i
				do not know why i need so many varibles and however after i reviewed the
				code again, i find that i wanted to get things together and make the
				results, however this has made it very complicated.
			</p>
			<p>4.What did you learn?</p>
			<p>
				first, use Pseudocode to analyse the whole funtion and break it down to
				small steps;
			</p>
			<p>
				then try to use console.log when thing is not working; also when we try
				to console.log, try to put it before return, as if computer see return,
				it won't continue execute console.log
			</p>
			<p>
				third, try to set variables if possible to make code clear and readable.
