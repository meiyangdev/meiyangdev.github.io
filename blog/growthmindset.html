				1.Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
				people
			</p>
			<p>
				the picture list 10 principles of neuroplasticity. To my understanding,
				the more we use it, the stronger or powerful our neruo and neruo
				connection will be. Spend time, and attention to practice repetitivelly
				will change our brain dramatically and improve our ability or skills on
				a specific field you practice.

				2.Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
				for your own benefit
			</p>
			<p>
				In my opinion, the principles talked about critical factors of gaining
				specific skill. So to develop my skills in developing, I would spend
				time to practice repetitivelly and also commbine my reflection in it.
			</p>
			<p>3.What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</p>
			<p>
				For me, I would exercise, try to take naps when I need, and also use my
				uncomfy hand which is the left hand to do daily jobs to improve my
				neuroplasticity.
			</p>
			<p>
				4.Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is the
				<a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/"
					>neuroplasticity page</a

				in positivepsychology and i found it is very useful.

			<p>1. Discuss what growthmindset is and why it is relevant</p>
			<p>
				A growth mindset, proposed by Stanford professor Carol Dweck in her book
				Mindset, describes people who believe that their success depends on time
				and effort. People with a growth mindset feel their skills and
				intelligence can be improved with effort and persistence. They embrace
				challenges, persist through obstacles, learn from criticism and seek out
				inspiration in othersâ€™ success.
			</p>
			<p>2.How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
			<p>
				I will embrace every challenges, and I know it is not gonna be easy,
				while i will still keep going as no pain, no gain. As long as i spend
				time and effort to practice, learn, reseach, try out and test, and try
				again, I will be there. Also, not only this, throughout whole life,
				growthmindset is so important, like we finished bootcamp, it does not
				mean that we finish learning, we will learn and grow throughout whole
				life journey.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a useful
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ">link</a> that
				Carol is talking about growthmindset.
