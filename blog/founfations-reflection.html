				1. What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
				as a result of the core learning?
			</p>
			<p>
				The first thing is knowing how to take break and calm down when I was
				stucking on some thing; Second is Becoming more and more capable of
				self-learning and searching online; Third is preparing my mindset that
				learning to reward myself when I successfully make the code run
				smoothly.
			</p>
			<p>
				2. What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning
				and programming?
			</p>
			<p>
				Respect different ways of thinking and doing code;Cooerating with
				classmates in teams and enjoy team working; Also need to take more
				initiative to communicate with facilitators when things is not going
				well even it is family stuff.
			</p>
			<p>3. What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
			<p>
				That is learning about growthmindset. After seraching and learning about
				growthmindset, I feel like I am not worrying too much about the setbacks
				that I will encounter in the future learning process. If it comes, I
				just take it as an opportunity to learn about new knowleges, syntax, and
				know how to achieve the goal by using them.
			</p>
			<p>4.What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
			<p>
				It is thinking like a web developer primer. To be honest, I am still
				learning about how to think like that when I was coding every time
			</p>
			<p>
				5.Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much
				time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
			</p>
			<p>
				Because we are here to get ourselves ready for a job. At workplace,
				skills includes soft skills and hard skills. Tech skills is essential
				for a developer, however, the soft skills, and the core skills, like
				recoginising yourself, knowing your values and belifs, building
				growthmindset and emotional intelligence is also critical for a good
				developer.
			</p>
			<p>
				6.Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste
				of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
				instead? Justify your answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				No, not at all. I think this is very essenial and important for me, who
				freshly step into the coding world as this has helped me so much at the
				beginning to prepare myself for the future setbacks and the growth.
